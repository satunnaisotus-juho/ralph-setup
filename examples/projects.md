## Sales and Marketing engine

We are building a sales and marketing harness for full automation of sales and marketing for a company. The UI will be claude code, so if you're unfamiliar with that look it up. The harness will use MCP-tools and claudes internal tools and implementation plan should include the following: 1. mocking MCP for testing, 2. mocking claude internal tools for testing, 3. building a comprehensive claude {skill, tool, hook command}-sets for claude, 4. bulding a company and instruction specific ralph-loop including the ralph prompt, ralph logging and ability to observe the eternal loop doing sales and marketing. Study @../ralph-setup/ to understand how ralph works for coding (we're going to do for marketing and sales) and study @../other-things/ -project to understand the structure of local MCP tooling. Then let's discuss.

## Sales and Marketing Harness

We are building a sales and marketing harness for full automation of sales and marketing of a company. The human UI will be claude code, so if you're unfamiliar with that look it up. The automatic harness will use MCP-tools and claudes internal tools. The automatic harness will be executed in a ralph-like automatic loop initiating a per task claude instance having access to all of the same tools, skills, commands and hooks a human working with the claude UI would. Let's discuss.
